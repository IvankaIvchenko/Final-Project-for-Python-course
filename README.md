Ivanka's Hangman Game

This project is a graphical implementation of the classic Hangman game built using Python and the Tkinter library. The game challenges players to guess a hidden word, one letter at a time, before running out of attempts.

Features

- Graphical Interface: A user-friendly interface with alphabet buttons for guessing letters and a canvas that displays the Hangman drawing.
- Dynamic Word Selection: Words are randomly chosen from a text file (wordlist.txt).
- Game States:
-- Displays progress as players guess letters.
-- Tracks incorrect guesses and reduces remaining attempts.
-- Ends the game with win/lose messages.
- Reset Option: Start a new game directly from the interface.
- Hangman Drawing: Visual feedback for incorrect guesses through progressive drawing of the Hangman figure.
